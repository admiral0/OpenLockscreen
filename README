1. What is libwidgets

libwidgets is a Qt + QML library that can be used to build
applications that needs widgets. libwidgets comes with many
features, including a widgets grid, docking capabilities,
package management, and backgrounds.

libwidgets also come with a mobile demo app, that is targeted
to Harmattan device like the Nokia N9. An experimental lock
screen widgets feature is also included.

2. Building and installing

a. For end users

If you want to build the mobile demo app, just do the following
(in a cross-compilation environnement)

- qmake CONFIG+=mobile
- make
- make install

b. For developers

If you want to use the library to build your own software, you
may want to only build the library, without the app. This is
actually the default behaviour.

- qmake
- make
- make install

By default, the libraries will be installed in /usr/lib/, and
/usr/lib(64)/qt4/imports/. You can tune these installation
folders by passing the needed prefix

- PREFIX is the prefix to all folders to set
- BINDIR is the directory where executables are stored
- LIBDIR is the directory where libraries are stored
- SHAREDIR is the directory where shared files are stored
- OPTDIR is the optified directory

In a developer build, BINDIR and SHAREDIR should not be used, but
in the application build it is used. Please note that on Harmattan,
SHAREDIR and BINDIR are not used. Instead, OPTDIR is used.

If you want to customize the import dir, you have two choice.
Either set IMPORTDIR, or use CONFIG+=noqtimport. The latter will
install the QML plugins in PREFIX/import/ instead of using
/usr/lib(64)/qt4/imports/.


All config switch

For the project
- CONFIG+=noqtimport installs the QML in PREFIX/import/.
- CONFIG+=mobile enables mobile app and mobile widgets.
- CONFIG+=desktop enables desktop app and desktop widgets.

For core widgets library
- CONFIG+=nopackagemanager disable package management features.
- CONFIG+=nodocks disable everything related to docks.

For additional widgets library
- CONFIG+=plugincolors enable the QML plugin that provides colors.
- CONFIG+=plugindocks enable the docks plugin.
- CONFIG+=pluginbackground enable the background plugin.
- CONFIG+=plugindrag enable the drag plugin.
- CONFIG+=pluginextra enable the extra plugin.


Note that if both mobile and desktop switches are set at the same
time, nothing is built.

Note that if enable nodocks switch and plugindocks, docks won't be
built nevertheless.

Note that if mobile or desktop switch are set, all additional plugins
are also built.

3. Documentation

Documentation on how to use widgets is available through doxygen.
Build it by parsing the qml-plugin folder. If you want to have
the full dock, including private classes, enable INTERNAL_DOCS.
